[![Integration Test](https://github.com/instill-ai/artifact-backend/actions/workflows/integration-test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/instill-ai/artifact-backend/actions/workflows/integration-test.yml)

ðŸ’¾ `Instill Artifact` orchestrates unstructured data to transform documents (e.g., HTML, PDF, CSV, PPTX, DOC), images (e.g., JPG, PNG, TIFF), audio (e.g., WAV, MP3 ) and video (e.g., MP4, MOV) into Instill Catalog - a unified AI-ready format. Instill Catalog is more than just a Knowledge Base; it is an Augmented Data Catalog for unstructured data and AI that ensures your data is clean, curated, and prepared for all of your future AI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) needs.
