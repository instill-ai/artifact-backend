# Basic RAG Pipeline (Indexing Step 2: Transformation Template)


## Pipeline Overview

This pipeline is designed to demonstrate the first step of the RAG indexing phase, which involves converting a .pdf file into a markdown string. The pipeline transforms a .pdf file into a markdown string, making it a default pipeline for Step 1 in a Knowledge Base application (pdf to markdown string).

## How to Use

To use this pipeline, you simply need to upload a .pdf file as document input. The pipeline will then convert the text in the .pdf into markdown.

**Input:**

* `document-input`: Upload a .pdf file

**Output:**

* `convert-result`: Markdown text of the .pdf
